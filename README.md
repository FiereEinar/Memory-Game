# Memory Game
Memory Game is a game that tests your memory. The player's main goal is to NOT click the same card teice or else the game is over.

## **Pupose**
This project was made to practice react, specifically practicing the use of useEffect and fetching data from an API. Aling side that I also learned how to use a component library as well as components from react itself.

## **Getting Started**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FiereEinar/Memory-Game.git
cd Memory-Game
npm install
npm run dev
```
